Activity: Python Function Practice Part 4
In this activity we are going to practice writing functions in Python. The prompts have been listed below. Work must be completed using a local code editor, and should be pushed to GitHub. Be sure to submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas when you are finished.

For each of the functions described below, plan the best way to write the function. Remember that there may be a recursive and an iterative solution to many problems. The best solution to any problem is the solution that you understand best. As long as your function is named correctly, accepts the correct parameters, and returns the correct output, you can be confident that you have succeeded at your task.

Write the Following Functions
Write a Python function called max_num()to find the maximum of three numbers.
Write a Python function called mult_list() to multiply all the numbers in a list.
Write a Python function called rev_string() to reverse a string.
Write a Python function called num_within() to check whether a number falls in a given range.
The function accepts the number, beginning of range, and end of range (inclusive) as arguments.
Examples: num_within(3,2,4) returns True, num_within(3,1,3) returns True, num_within(10,2,5) returns False.
Write a Python function called pascal() that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
The function accepts the number n, the number of rows to print
Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal. Each number is the two numbers above it added together.

Acceptance Criteria
Each of the functions described exists in the Python file.
Each of the functions is named correctly, accepts the correct parameters, returns the correct output, and has been called inside the file (so that each function runs automatically when the file is run).
The file runs with no errors.
Before submitting, make sure you do a self review of your code, check for formatting, spelling, include comments in your code, and ensure you have a healthy commit history.

Make sure to submit your GitHub repository link on Canvas.
